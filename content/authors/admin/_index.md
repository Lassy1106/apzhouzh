My research is dedicated to solving practical problems of China's platform companies based on platform theory. I am developing a theory of platform competitive advantage from the following two perspectives: 

1) How platform strategy and design affect long-term platform moat; 
2) Whether the platform harms social welfare when it uses platform strategy and design to enhance its competitive advantage. My research on innovation and entrepreneurship in the digital economy includes how to initiate a platform business and how to initiate a business on the platform.
